# My To-Do Site

This was my first to-do app that I built while learning frontend development.

It is a simple project made using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.  
Tasks are saved using localStorage so they don’t disappear on refresh.

## Features
- Add and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Filter tasks (all / active / completed)
- Data stored in localStorage

This project was made mainly for learning and practice.
